# Watch Only Bitcoin Wallet

A simple tool to keep track of all your bitcoin addresses with their balance using block explorers APIs.

![Preview](/Doc/Images/MainPreview.jpg)

You can import addresses one by one or in bulk from a text file. Each address can have a
name or tag as a reminder of what that address is.  
Balance and bitcoin price are updated using various API services that you can select from the
settings window.  

Using the ForkBalance window you can check if your address had any balance at the time when 
some of the past altcoins were created out of bitcoin, like bitcoin-cash.
